```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading data


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Microniche analysis

Test for the niche analysis.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

We'll see if it works. 
Second test now.
An that's a third test. 
And a fourth test. 


And now, this is a first test to see if the push-command works (hopefuly yes)


Woow second test

That's a whole new test to add stuff from another session. (the github buttons does not appear)
